{
  # This is the Iterator_Meta_and_Saves.R script. It defines functions that deal 
  # with the meta level of describing results in plot captions or file names, 
  # summarizing metadata and saving results.

# 1. Define Functions ----------------------------------------------------------

# clust_auto_file_Name()
{
  #' Automatically generates a file name or file path
  #'
  #' @param prefix As a char. What should the file name start with? It could be
  #' a folder to make it a file path, such as "Outputs/", or any other tag, or
  #' "".
  #'
  #' @param suffix As a char. What should the file name end with? It should be a
  #' file extension such as ".txt" or ".RData" at minimum, but it could also be
  #' more, such as "report.txt".
  #'
  #' @param trial_run Is this a trial run of the iterator or serious results?
  #' Takes a boolean. If this is a trial run, the save file names, logs and plot
  #' captions will reflect this. 
  #'
  #' @param testdata_type A string that serves as a name or label for your 
  #' testdata. It will be included in the plot description and save file names 
  #' (if the results is saved to the outputs folder).
  #' 
  #' @param reshuffle_or_subset A string that indicates if these results were 
  #' gained using cluster annotation reshuffling or subsetting.
  #'
  #' @param number_ranks A named list of which top-ranks were considered 
  #' significant per method.
  #'
  #' @param time_of_run The char tag of the time the script started being
  #' executed.
  #'
  #' @return A file name that starts with the prefix, ends with the suffix and
  #' contains a bunch of parameter tags in between. This way the user can
  #' identify the save file by the parameters it was set up with.
