### Background
##### scRNA-Seq data was aquired via SeuratData for human [Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4380?source=post_page#Abs2).
     
     

#### Load Results from different Method-Resource Combinations
##### Note that the objects loaded here were already generated via the pipeline for each method
```{r load_res}

### Main Text Plots
#### Combine all binary results into heatmap (top500)
Overlap in the 500 highest ranked CCC interactions between different combinations
of methods and resources. Method-resource combinations were clustered according 
to binary (Jaccard index) distances. SCA refers to the SingleCellSignalR method.
```{r binary_heat_main, fig.width=46, fig.height=23}

png(filename = figure_path_mr('cbmc_binheat_top500.png'),
    width = 3000,
    height = 1700)

p <- get_BinaryHeat(top_lists$top_500)
grid::grid.draw(p$gtable)
invisible(dev.off())
grid::grid.draw(p$gtable)
```

#### Activity per Cell type
##### Inferred as the proportion of interaction edges that stem from Source Cell clusters or lead to Target Cell clusters in the highest ranked interactions. 
```{r binary_cell_activity_main, fig.width=46, fig.height=23}

p <- get_activecell(top_lists$top_500)

png(filename = figure_path_mr('cbmc_activityheat_top500.png'),
    width = 3000,
    height = 1700)
grid::grid.draw(p$gtable)
invisible(dev.off())

grid::grid.draw(p$gtable)
```
   
   
#### Jaccard index Heatmap
```{r jacc_index, fig.width=40, fig.height=36}
# Similarity Heatmap (according to Jaccard index)
p <- get_simdist_heatmap(top_lists$top_500,
                         sim_dist = "simil",
