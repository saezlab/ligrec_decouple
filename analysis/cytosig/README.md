# Agreement with Cytokine Signalling

In this analysis, we used all three BRCA subtypes for the agreement between CCC scores obtained from LIANA and Cytokine activities obtained
using the signatures from [Jian et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01274-5) with [decoupleR](https://github.com/saezlab/decoupleR).

# Cytokine signatures
CytoSig's Cytokine activity signatures were obtained from https://github.com/data2intelligence/CytoSig/tree/master/CytoSig.

## Datasets
The [Wu et al., 21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00911-1) Human Breast Cancer (BRCA) atlas cancer using in the spatial evaluation was also used here.
