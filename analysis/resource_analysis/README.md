# Resource Descriptive Analysis

To reproduce results simply run [resource_plot.R]().

Everything required to generate the plots will be automatically acquired via [OmniPathR](https://github.com/saezlab/OmnipathR/)


Supp Tables 2&4 and top 50 heatmaps are generated using `supp_table_2and4_response.R`
after `resource_plot.R` has been ran.
